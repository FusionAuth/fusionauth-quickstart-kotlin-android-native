# Quickstart: Android App with FusionAuth Android SDK

This repository contains an Android app extracted from the FusionAuth Android SDK that works with a locally running instance of [FusionAuth](https://fusionauth.io/), the authentication and authorization platform.

This example uses the FusionAuth Android SDK 0.2.0 release.

<!--
this and following tags, and the corresponding end tag, are used to delineate what is pulled into the FusionAuth docs site (the client libraries pages). Don't remove unless you also change the docs site.

Please also use ``` instead of indenting for code blocks. The backticks are translated correctly to adoc format.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
<!--
tag::forDocSitePrerequisites[]
-->
You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio): The official IDE for Android helps you develop and install the necessary tools to set it up.
  - At least Java 17 (which you can install via Android Studio)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth. Ensure you also have [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.
  - (Alternatively, you can [Install FusionAuth Manually](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).

### FusionAuth Installation via Docker
<!--
tag::forDocSiteDocker[]
-->
The root of this project directory _(next to this README)_ are two files: [a Docker compose file](./docker-compose.yml) and an [environment variables configuration file](./.env). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up FusionAuth up on your machine with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The FusionAuth configuration files also make use of a unique feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart): when FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the [Kickstart file](kickstart/kickstart.json) and mimic API calls to configure FusionAuth for use when it is first run. 

> **NOTE**: If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by Docker Compose by executing `docker compose down -v`. 

FusionAuth will be initially configured with these settings:
* Your client Id is: `21e13847-4f30-4477-a2d9-33c3a80bd15a`
* Your `Example Android App` test user `richard@example.com` and your password is `password`.
* Your FusionAuth admin username is `admin@example.com` and your password is `password`.
* Your fusionAuthBaseUrl to access FusionAuth is `http://localhost:9011/`

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker/Kickstart you don't need to.

### Running the Android App
<!--
tag::forDocSiteRun[]
-->
This Android Quickstart is fully functional and can be used without any modifications:

- Open this project's `complete-application` folder in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
- Either [connect a hardware device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device) or create an Android Virtual Device to run the [Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).
- [Build and run the app](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/) following Android Studio guidelines.

And there are additional [testing instructions](TESTING.md) available for different scenarios.

## Further Information

Please follow the following sections for further information about the Quickstart and FusionAuth Android SDK.

### Quickstart

See the [FusionAuth Android Quickstart](https://fusionauth.io/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-android-java-native-fusionauth-sdk/) for a full tutorial on using FusionAuth and Android.

### Documentation FusionAuth Android SDK

See the [FusionAuth Android SDK Documentation](https://fusionauth.io/docs/sdks/android-sdk) for an overview to the SDK. Or see the latest [Full library documentation](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-android-sdk/blob/main/library/docs/index.md) for the complete documentation of the SDK.

### Automated End 2 End Testing

While developing the Android SDK we made use of Automated End 2 End Testing within the [Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator). This is something useful during App development and we moved the test as well into the quickstart and further documented our testing implementation [here](TESTING.md).

<!--
Maintainer info on how to create the example App manually:

The example App is a copy from https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-android-sdk/tree/main/app by:

1. Create a new Android project with Kotlin and Gradle
2. copy the app/src folder from the sdk in to the app/ folder
3. copy the app/build.gradle.kts from the sdk in to the app/ folder
4. remove lint configuration for sarifReport from it
5. replace implementation(project(":library")) with implementation("io.fusionauth:fusionauth-android-sdk:0.1.1") and use accordingly the latest release version
6. copy the fusionauth/<latest version>/ from the sdk to fusionauth/
7. make sure gradlew is on the same version as the sdk by running e.g. ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 8.6
8. test the app by first starting fusionauth and then run the app.
9. once successful manually tested do a full End 2 End test by running ./gradlew clean connectedAndroidTest
10. once successful commit your changes
11. create a new tag according to the tag of the io.fusionauth:fusionauth-android-sdk e.g. 0.1.1
